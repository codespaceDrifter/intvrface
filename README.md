"the intvrface for the model to interact with the world"


this is completely local. and built FOR THE MODEL not for internet users. 
b2a software. buisness to ai.
directly in terminal. not even TUI. 
this can then be installed as a pip package to be used in ai-plus-plus.com which is user facing
store all text in json dont do fancy databases

hate ai wrappers? this is ONE wrapper to RULE them all. 

this should support BOTH API and LOCAL models.
this is basically a list of MCP apis for the models to call. priotize simplicity.

1: memory api. this is long term memory for the model. both for model to memorize it's progress in it's own tasks, and for model to memorize things about the user. maybe add a todo list for it. 
2: terminal api. for the model to launch a docker then get terminal input and write to terminal
3: more advanced code help: file editing, git, prompts reminding models to TEST the code
4: specialized model calling. voice chat api. allows the model to call a local/online voice model to listen and speak. image gen apis.
5: web search api. 
6: specialized software. i.e. svmbolsolve and phvsicsim. 
7: computer use GUI? feed in images, feed out to computer click coordinates and keyboard inputs


leave the card based memory user controlled or chat branches all those human focused stuff to ai-plus-plus
