"the intvrface for the model to interact with the world"

let the model interact with external text memory, computer use, MCP function calling, and humans. this is model centric not user centric. 
this is everything OUTSIDE a model. other projects, nvnopara is the software of a model, tvrchrun is the algorithms, mindmech is the theory that underlies a model, this is the external software around a model. 

make it so that i would actually use this always rather than the official chatgpt.com website

card like aesthetics (card blocks, drag and drop, edits, slight shadow, color)

assume all are logged in. 

several tabs:
1: chat tab: interact with humans.  card based memory, auto summary memory and keyword match? card based saved prompts, can draw lines between stuff to add context, draw lines to group stuff into projects. allows user to pay for more usage CROSS llms open router
optional voice dictation also, optional voice response
the ideal is you just type without switching chats and the model knows everything about you (this is both for coding and preparing for building yvki / other systems)

2: MCP integration. add function calling to other apis. 

3: benchmark tab. shows RAN benchmarks on all major public tests and all major models. allows user to pay to 1: take a test and see how high they rank or 2: upload their own test and have models run them
4: mech interp tab. trained SaE cross coder showing inference maps on ONE SMALL open source model. allow users to PAY to inference them and construct a graph. 

5: computer use. use commands to control a rented linux computer. 

monetize this. make this online. but do allow a limited free version (capped globally)
since i already bought some more domains, simply ROUTE them TO this subdomain pages like just route ai-bvnch.come TO this tab for ai bench

maybe integrate the "code flow" website into this. because i can 1: generate a card graph from the different code documents and generate summaries. 2: the model can use it to plan
